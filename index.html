        <p>As a Front End Developer, I love to build responsive websites that require conceptual and analytical thinking. Iâ€™m excited to learn more, and honing my skills on Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and learning modern React with Redux.
        I am currently working on expanding my toolset in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, front and back-end programming skills, but my ultimate goal to become a primary front-end developer with some back-end knowledge.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. </p>
        <p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>
